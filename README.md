Solution overview
</h2>

This solution accelerator enhances the efficiency of Microsoft Sustainability Manager by adding the ability to effortlessly create, assign, manage, and track tasks. Following the same UI, UX and architecture of MSM, this accelerator introduces a task table having custom N:1 relationships with multiple MSM tables so users (Sustainability Managers, Analysts and other personas) can create, assign, track and manage tasks. The accelerator also has 2 custom security roles so managers can create & assign tasks throughout the organization whereas Analysts would be able to view, create & edit tasks assigned to them. Additionally, there will be notifications sent out in Microsoft Teams and Outlook upon task creation through Power Automate.

### Key features
<details open>
¬† <summary>Click to learn more about the key features this solution enables</summary>

  - **Task Creation and assignment** <br/>
  The ability to quickly create tasks, related to the use of MSM, and assign them to team members in the same tool, MSM, that will be used to resolve the tasks according to security roles.  
    
  - **Progress tracking** <br/>
  Visualization of progress, status, and dates enables rapid and clear monitoring to ensure tasks are on track to meet deadlines. This helps in identifying any delays or bottlenecks early.
  
  - **Notifications and reminders** <br/>
  Automated notifications help ensure that team members are aware of upcoming deadlines, task assignments. This feature reduces the need for frequent follow-ups and keeps everyone aligned.
  
  - **Custom security roles** <br/>
  Customizable security roles to grant and limit visibility to view and edit tasks based on persona.  This ensures the Sustainability Manager can view all tasks and Sustainability Analysts can view only their own tasks. 
  
  - **Collaboration and communication** <br/>
  Built-in collaboration with comments and real-time updates within tasks allows the assigner to provide additional context, answer questions, and ensure that everyone involved has the information they need to complete the tasks effectively.

### How to install or deploy
Please click this [**Link to Deployment Guide**](./Deployment/README.md) for instructions on how to deploy and set up the solution accelerator. 

{üü®TODO: Remove if Azure OpenAI quota check is not required }

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability - Do not have content**
 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

<br/>

### Prerequisites and Costs - Do not have content
{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific notes like role requirements}

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: {üü®TODO: Update with suggested regions specific to this solution}

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

{üü®TODO: Call out specific pricing "gotchas" like Azure Container Registry if known}

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific estimate sheet}

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/68b51f4cb79a4466b631a11aa57e9c16) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used.

![Landing Page](./Deployment/images/readme/landingPage.png)

As a Sustainability Manager or Sustainability Analyst, you will be able to deploy this accelerator on top of your existing MSM environment. This will allow you to
 1. Create, manage, track, and assign tasks as a Sustainability Manager specific to MSM tables like Emissions, Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 activity tables, Accounts etc. You can create generic tasks for data validation, data import, etc. This also allows you to get a 360 view of all scheduled, completed and in-progress tasks to help you to prioritize, delegate, and track progress.
 2. As a Analyst, you will receive notifications when a task is assigned to the user. There will be custom views to track & manage tasks assigned to the logged in user.

{üü®TODO: Fill in with solution specific security guidelines similar to the below}

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
